## Fibonacci
<ol>
<li>
Using iteration, write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8, this method should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].
</li>
<li>
Now write another method #fibs_rec which solves the same problem recursively. This can be done in just 3 lines (or 1 if you’re crazy, but don’t consider either of these lengths a requirement… just get it done).
</li>
</ol>

## Merge Sort
<ol>
<li>
Build a method #merge_sort that takes in an array and returns a sorted array, using a recursive merge sort methodology.
</li>
<li>
Tips:
<ol>
<li>
Think about what the base case is and what behavior is happening again and again and can actually be delegated to someone else (e.g. that same method!).

It may be helpful to check out the background videos again if you don’t quite understand what should be going on.
