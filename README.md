## Fibonacci
<ol>
<li>
Using iteration, write a method #fibs which takes a number and returns an array containing that many numbers from the fibonacci sequence. Using an example input of 8, this method should return the array [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13].
</li>
<li>
Now write another method #fibs_rec which solves the same problem recursively. This can be done in just 3 lines (or 1 if you’re crazy, but don’t consider either of these lengths a requirement… just get it done).
</li>
</ol>

## Merge Sort
We spent some time early on dealing with sorting (e.g. bubble sort). Now it’s time to take another look at sorting with Merge Sort, a type of sort that lends itself well to recursion and can be much faster than bubble sort on the right data sets. You’ll build a method which sorts a given array but uses a “merge sort” method for doing so.

It can be a bit strange to wrap your head around, but just remember you’re “dividing and conquering” the problem.
